# my-python-work
This repo is basically my Python playground — full of experiments, tests, and a few files that probably shouldn’t see the light of day but are here anyway.

What’s inside:
OOP: Where I tried to make Python behave like Java.

File Handling: Opening, reading, writing… and occasionally deleting by mistake.

Regular Expression: My personal war with backslashes and brackets.

Web Scrapping: When I decided to let Python do the copy-pasting for me.

MultiThreading: When one thread wasn’t enough to handle my curiosity.

PDBC and Package: Some attempts at connecting Python to databases (and surviving).

Random notebooks: Lists, strings, exceptions, and other adventures.

This collection grew as I learned Python, fixed bugs, broke things again, and slowly figured out how it all works.

Note:
I made most of this back in my learning days and finally decided to push it to GitHub — because nostalgia counts as productivity.
