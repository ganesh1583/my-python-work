honor20, Abhishek M nair, 5, Just wow!, I purchased Honor 20 on 19th June 2020 and i would say this was my the best choice i made at this price.... Flawless performance with kirin 980 Soc processor and no lag in day to day usage... I loved the device alot. Display size is 6.26 and its so comfortable to use with one hand which i mostly prefer. Battery is 3750mah but its far better than many other phones in the market woth higher battery backup... Honor 20 battery lasts much longer than i expected. Camera is another main thing i like...
